# ScandAI – Tech Forward NEXUS

> An AI-powered collaboration platform for Sweden's industrial ecosystem, built for **Teknikföretagen** (Technology Industries of Sweden).

## 🚀 What is ScandAI?

ScandAI connects 4,500+ Swedish industrial companies through three AI-driven modules that enable anonymous problem-solving, resource sharing, and strategic partnerships — all within a trust-first framework.

## 🧩 Core Modules

### 🔒 Trust Vault
Anonymous problem-solving where companies post challenges without revealing their identity. AI matches problems to potential solvers. A **Double-Blind Handshake** protocol reveals identities only when both parties opt in.

### ♻️ Symbiosis Agent
Industrial resource matching that turns one company's waste into another's raw material. AI scans waste streams and production surplus to find circular economy opportunities, with built-in smart contract generation.

### 🤝 AI Matchmaker
Strategic partner discovery powered by AI. Companies are scored and matched based on complementary capabilities, R&D focus, and market alignment across the Teknikföretagen member network.

## 🗃️ Real Data

The platform is backed by a real database of **4,500+ Teknikföretagen member companies**, including Volvo, Scania, Ericsson, SAAB, ABB, Hitachi Energy, and more. The Network page allows full search and filtering by sector, city, and company size.

## 🔐 Authentication

Mock authentication gates the ScandAI dashboard while keeping the landing page public.
